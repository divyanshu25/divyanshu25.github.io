There is currently no treatment or vaccine for coronavirus and our best defense against it is properly wearing a face mask. Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s been observed that a lot of people do not wear their masks properly thus putting their and other’s life at risk of catching this deadly virus.\nProblem As pandemic fatigue sets in around the country, more and more people are eschewing face mask use. Being able to identify whether a person is properly wearing a mask or not is crucial to identify and prevent a potential outbreak. We propose a face mask detector that can identify whether an individual is wearing a facemask or not.\nData Collection We are using FaceMask 12K dataset on kaggle. The dataset is split into 10,000 in training, 992 in test and 800 in validation and has equal representation of both classes.\nWe are not doing any explicit feature selection on the data. We rely on CNNs and VAE to automatically learn these features while training. The dataset that we obtained is balanced between the two classes so we are not performing any explicit data cleaning.\nMethods  We propose the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to tackle the problem. We model the problem as a binary classification task, where individuals wearing a mask pertain to positive class and individuals not wearing a mask pertain to negative class. We choose Pytorch as our preferred framework to develop the project. We use both supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods to achieve the mentioned goal. We have also implemented grad-cam to visulaize what our model is learning. Details of all these approaches are discussed below.\nSupervised Learning We have developed deep neural networks to perform the binary classification task using various off the shelf models.\nArchitectures Resnet ResNet is a Convolutional Neural Network model. The major problem that ResNet addresses is how it is not just important to have multiple layers stacked to get better results. In fact, having deep layers gives rise to the vanishing gradient problem and also the accuracy gets saturated and later would degrade. ResNet introduces a residual learning block where an identity mapping is added at the end of the block to solve the degradation problem as follows:   The hypothesis is that instead of expecting the stacked layer to fit the desired mapping function, an identity mapping is used to let it fit the residual mapping which makes it easier to reduce the error towards zero. This is achieved by introducing shortcut connections between the stacked layers to add the identity mapping. The assumption is that the identity mappings do not introduce additional parameters. It is shown that with this approach, error is reduced with deeper layers:\nEfficient Net -- EfficientNet is a new technique achieving state-of-the-art image classification accuracy from Google AI research. This technique rethinks the way we scale convolutional neural networks. Traditionally, one way to scale up CNN is to add more layers, for example, ResNet18 to ResNet 200. In EfficenetNet, this is done systematically which looks at three properties, width, depth and_resolution. \nWidth scaling captures fine-grained features by adding more feature maps; depth scaling adds more layers to the CNN and finally resolution scaling is changing the size of the input image. Scaling any of these will improve performance but it quickly plateaus as the images below shows.\n\nLeft is width scaling, middle is depth scaling, and then far right is image resolution scaling, hence performance is gained on each but it quickly saturates. The authors then discovered that there is a synergy in scaling multiple dimensions together. Meaning if you increase depth you will also see a performance boost when you increase image resolution as well. So there is a dependency amongst scaling each of these dimensions.\n-- After extensive grid search, they derived the theoretically optimal formula for compound scaling using these coefficients. Compound scaling method is the key idea in EfficenetNet which balances the up sampling with Width, Depth and Resolution by scaling with a constant ratio.\nAlexnet AlexNet architecture was proposed by Alex Krizhevsky, Illya Sutskever and Geoffrey E. Hinton, and became popular in 2012 after competing and won in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in achieving top-5 error of 15.3%. Getting these rates of accuracy was quite rare at the time and it is what ignited CNN into the mainstream. AlexNet has five convolution layers some of which follow a max-pooling layer and finally three fully connected layers. This architecture also popularized ReLU activation function which improved training performance over Tanh and Sigmoid, and used dropout instead of other methods of regularization to avoid overfitting.  \nGoogleNet GoogLeNet was the winner of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge of 2014 that focused on efficient computation and deeper networks while achieving higher accuracy. This network is 22-layer deep with 27 pooling layers. The key component is the 9 inception modules stacked linearly followed by an average pooling layer connected to the end of the inception modules. The Inception module is simply the concatenation across 3 convolutions, scales a 1 x 1 convolution, a 3 x 3 convolution, a 5 x 5 convolution and a 3 x 3 max pooling. One of the benefits of using multiple web convolutions on a single patch is that visual information is being processed at several scales then aggregated. Hence, inception modules give us the knobs and levers of controlled balancing of computer resources and speed.  \nOptimizers:  We experimented with the following optimizers to train our network:\n Adam Stochastic Gradient Descent ADADELTA Average Stochastic Gradient Descent  Unsupervised Learning For unsupervised learning, we used Variational Autoencoder. Specifically, we aim to use Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction and map the input observations from a high-dimensional feature space to a low-dimensional feature space without signiﬁcant information loss. Since autoencoders can capture the non-linear relations between the features, they are a powerful tool to detect subtleties in the input and therefore helps to augment the dataset. This way we can increase the overall training accuracy of our classification task. We will first describe a general training procedure for an autoencoder and then extend it to variational autoencoder in the next section. Training a autoencoder is two step process:\n Unsupervised Training: In this step we take an autoencoder, which is essentially a combination of an encoder and a decoder. The loss is defined by L2 loss which is also called reconstruction loss in this setting. We then pass the images through the autoencoder to minimize the reconstruction loss.   Supervised Training: After the autoencoder is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss, we throw away the decoder and hope that the latent representation (z) has effectively compressed the crucial information of an image.   Then we finetune the obtained encoder for our binary classification downstream task.   Variational Autoencoders: Variational autoencoders work in a similar fashion as an autoencoder. The difference is that in variational autoencoders instead of sampling a static latent representation z we sample two vectors, μ and σ, which reprensents mean and standard deviation. Then we use μ and σ to sample a new latent vector z from the gaussian distribtion.   Loss function is also modified to account for KL divergence along with reconstruction loss. Architecture specifications of our VAE model:  The encoder has 5, 2d Convolution layers with kernel size 3, stride 2 and padding 1. The decoder has 5, 2d Convolution layers with kernel size 3, stride 2 and padding 1. LeakyReLu is used as the activation function after every hidden layer along with a batch normalization layer.   Visualization  Grad-Cam GradCAM is a visualization technique which does not need any re-training for the Convolutional Neural Network based models. It creates a heatmap of features critical to image classification. We initially used a pytorch implementation of GradCAM, maintained by Vicky Liin and were able to get useful visualizations for ResNet and AlexNet but due to the limitations on the number of architectures the library supports, we chose to switch to the Captum implementation of gradcam.

This approach depends solely on how well an image has been tagged by a human user. In this project we aim to change the status quo by also including the images itself in the search process. At its core, our project focuses on looking at an image to extract relevant features, which in turn can be used to generate textual descriptions of the image. We then compute various similarity measures between these textual descriptions and a user provided query to return the most relevant images. We then extend this system to search similar images given an input image.\nIntroduction Image search using textual description is a very powerful tool with numerous applications. In contrast to the traditional setting, where image retrieval is performed by looking up metadata, we propose to build a system that can query an image by using its features to generate a textual description. Writing metadata for a ever-growing set of images is an intractable task. In most cases the images either don\u0026rsquo;t have metadata or have incorrect metadata. This project aims to break that dependency and use the implicit information within the image for retrieval.\nOur model is built on an image captioning system and computing various similarity measures to fetch images based on the closeness between textual query and generated image captions. In this project we have used two architectures, one is called vanilla architecture where we use a CNN-encoder to generate image features and a LSTM model as decoder, and second is attention architecture where we again use a CNN-encoder to generate image features and an attention based LSTM model as decoder. We will go into details of both these architectures in subsequent sections. We are using COCO and Flickr8k datasets, both these datasets provide 5 human generated captions per image. The main modules that are implemented in this project are:\n  Implemented both vanilla and attention architectures, and tested both the architectures on various hyper-parameters.\n  Implemented a module to compute BLEU score of both vanilla and attention architecture on COCO and Flickr8k datasets.\n  We have developed an weighted cosine-similarity mechanism by computing the cosine-similarity between embeddings of textual query and generated captions and weighting them with inverse word frequency to fetch top 5 relevant images.\n  Implemented an REST-API architecture to query images.\n  Extended the image search system to search based on images instead of the textual description.\n  Related Work Deep Fragment Embeddings for Bidirectional Image Sentence Mapping: Our initial inspiration for image retrieval from came from Deep fragment embeddings. Here the authors use a object detection model to extract fragments of images (objects). They also extract fragments of sentences. Fragments from both images and sentences are embedded in a common embedding space and explicitly reasons about their latent, inter-modal correspondences. They use a cosine-similarity based loss function where they take embeddings from image space and sentence space compute there dot product.\nOur project is based on a similar approach but instead of comparing common embeddings from images and sentences we use a image captioning system to generate novel captions for an images and then use those captions to compute similarity between the given query. Our loss function (weighted-cosine similarity) is similar to their loss function, but differs in the fact that they compute fragment level loss whereas we compute a global loss.\nMethodology At core of our project we use an image captioning model to generate captions for an image, then we store those captions in a database. Then on being provided with a textual query we iterate over all the generated captions in the database, compute the various similarity metrics between the user textual query and generated captions and finally return the images with top5 similarity scores. We have used two datasets - Flickr8k and COCO , to evaluate our model. Both these datasets provide 5 user generated captions per image. In subsequent section we will go over various architecture that we experimented with in our captioning model.\nImage Captioning Model Vanilla CNN-LSTM network The vanilla architecture uses a pretrained Resnet50 model to encode the image features. These features are concatenated with the embeddings of true captions and fed to a single layered Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The embedding and LSTM layers are trained from scratch. The outputs of the trained LSTM are used to generate the predicted captions.\nCNN-LSTM with attention In this architecture we use an attention mechanism in a single layered LSTM to give attention to image features along with previous generated word. The approach is taken from the paper \u0026ldquo;Show, attend and tell\u0026rdquo; . We use a pretrained Resnet101 model to generate image features. At each step of LSTM the image features and the last hidden state of LSTM is passed through an attention layer. The output of the attention layer is concatenated with the embeddings of the word generated in last step of LSTM to generate the current word.\nCNN-LSTM with attention using BERT embedding In this variant, we used our attention CNN-LSTM network along with a pretrained BERT embedding layer instead of training the embedding layer from scratch. The pretrained BERT model already has learnt language embeddings over a large dataset and has proven to be successful in many downstream language tasks. We load the pretrained weights in the embedding layer and then fine-tune it for our own down stream task.\nCaption Generation and Search API Textual search We use beam search to sample top five predictions for each image in our test set and saved these to an Sqlite database. Now when a textual query is provided we iterate over all the images in the database and compute the similarity between the embeddings of textual query and each of the 5 generated captions for a particular image and store the max value. After iterating over all the images we return the images with top 5 similarity scores. To compute the similarity we experiment with two metrics, BLEU-score and weighted cosine similarity between embedded captions and query. Details of both these similarity metrics will be covered in a later section. To generate the embeddings we have experimented with two variants:\n  We generate embeddings using the embedding layer that was trained from scratch during the training process.\n  We use the pre-trained BERT model\u0026rsquo;s embedding layer and further train it and use it to generate the embeddings.\n  Similar image search We then extended the above textual search to search for similar images, given an input image. To do this we first generate the caption of the input image and then use the above search mechanism to produce the related images. The quality of the produced results directly depends on the image captioning system and this corroborates with the outputs we observed in our experiments.\nExperiments We experiment with two datasets: Flickr8k and COCO.\nFlickr8k contains 8,091 images collected from Flickr. The dataset in composed of images depicting people and animals doing various activities. Each image consist of 5 human generated captions. We use publicly available splits for train, validation and test sets. Validation and train sets consists of 1000 images each.\nCOCO is the largest image captioning dataset, containing 118,000, 5,000 and 40,670 images for training, validation and test respectively. This dataset is more challenging, since most images contain multiple objects in the context of complex scenes. Each image has 5 human annotated captions. To ease our training and evaluation times, we use 30000 images from the training set for training, 1000 images from the validation set for validation and 1500 images from the withheld validation set for testing.\nPre-processing We truncate captions longer than 40 words for COCO and for Flickr8k. We then build a vocabulary of words that occur at least 5 times in the training set, resulting in 11372 and 3005 words for COCO and Flickr8k respectively. When using pretrained bert-embeddings, we use bert tokenizer which has a vocabulary size of 30,522.\nHyper-Paramters: We use the following hyper-parameters to train our model:\n  Learning Rate: 0.001, Batch Size: 128, Optimizer: ADAM, Momentum: 0.9, Weight Decay: 0.99, Scheduler Weight Decay: 0.95, Dropout: 0.5\n  Embedding Size: 512, Hidden Size: 512, Image Feature Size: 2048, Attention vector Size: 512, Encoded Image Size: 14\n  Compared Approaches: For offline evaluation on Flickr8k and COCO , we compare the following models in this project:\n  Vanilla Model (Vanilla CNN-LSTM), In this model we use features generated by Resnet50 CNN model and pass it to a LSTM model to predict output words.\n  Attention model (CNN-LSTM with Attention) which uses a hard attention mechanism to predict words in LSTM decoder.\n  Attention model with BERT embeddings. In this model we train our CNN-LSTM with Attention model with pre-trained BERT embeddings and also fine tune the embedding layer.\n  The goal of this comparison is to verify that the improvements are caused specifically by the attention mechanism and BERT embeddings, and are not the result of orthogonal contributions (e.g. better CNN features or better optimization). We further compare our method with Adaptive Attention , Google NIC and Hard-Attention .\nResults Training mechanism: Using the above hyperparameters, we trained all three models on the two datasets for 20 epochs each. The graphs in Fig [1,2,3,4] show the training and validation loss for each of these.\nQuantitative Analysis: We report our results for evaluating the image captioning model on COCO and Flickr8k datasets using BLEU score. Table shows the BLEU score with 1,2,3 and 4-grams for both our vanilla and attention models trained over COCO and Flickr8k datasets.\nIn search API to fetch top-5 relevant images for a given query we use the following metrics.\n  BLEU-Score: We used BLEU-score as a similarity metric, where we take top 5 generated captions from an image and compute the BLEU score against the user given query. We return the results with top-5 BLEU scores. In this approach we also experimented with BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, n-grams and found that BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 give the best results.\n  Weighted Cosine Similarity: In this approach we compute the embeddings the user query and caption generated by our model using the learned embedding layer. The embeddings are a 2D tensor of shape (caption length × embed dimension). Now for each caption in our database, we compute the matrix multiplication of the query\u0026rsquo;s embedding with the caption\u0026rsquo;s embedding. For example, if the query length is 3, the caption length is 4 and the embedding length is 768, the query\u0026rsquo;s embedding (Q) would be of size (3×768) and the caption\u0026rsquo;s embedding (C) would be of size (4×768). We now compute (Q×C') to get a (3×4) dimension matrix. We then take a max along the rows of the matrix to get (3×1) vector which represents the similarity of the query and the caption. We then weight the obtained vector by inverse word-frequency and then finally we sum it up to obtain a similarity score. The figure below illustrates the process. In the figure \u0026ldquo;A dog is sleeping\u0026rdquo; is the generated caption and \u0026ldquo;Dog is running\u0026rdquo; is user given query.\n  \n   BLEU Scores Flickr8k    MS-COCO        Architecture BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4 BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4   Vanilla 0.506 0.304 0.191 0.121 0.622 0.412 0.281 0.200   Attention 0.597 0.405 0.278 0.189 0.671 0.472 0.338 0.245   Attention with BERT 0.605 0.415 0.286 0.196 0.614 0.421 0.294 0.210   Hard-Attention 0.670 0.457 0.314 0.213 0.718 0.504 0.357 0.250   Adaptive Attention 0.677 0.494 0.354 0.251 0.742 0.580 0.439 0.332   Google NIC 0.630 0.410 0.270 - 0.666 0.461 0.329 0.246    Qualitative Analysis Based on qualitative analysis of our search results, we tried multiple similarity metrics to find matching images for the search query from our database. In Appendix show examples of query results searched on both datasets using captions generated from all three model variants.\n  We first generated search results based on the highest BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 score calculated between the query and the predicted captions for each image. Since we are storing five predicted captions per image, the summation of BLEU scores with all predicted captions of the image was taken to be the similarity score of the image with the query. The major drawback in this method was the equal weightage being given to \u0026ldquo;filler\u0026rdquo; words in the query like prepositions and conjunctions. This sometimes inflated the score of long but irrelevant captions in the database and led to many irrelevant results being thrown out along with relevant ones.\n  To avoid above drawback, we filtered all \u0026ldquo;stopwords\u0026rdquo; from the query and captions before computing BLEU score. This removed filler words from the comparison and significantly improved search results.\n  On further inspection, we observed that for good results we needed to give more importance to the rarely occurring words in our corpus as compared to more commonly occurring words. For example, in a query like \u0026ldquo;A person sitting with a laptop\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; is a very common word present in many captions but \u0026ldquo;laptop\u0026rdquo; is a rarer word. Our current metrics give equal importance to the two words, throwing results with just a person in them if it could not find both person and laptop. However, we consider results containing a laptop to be more relevant in this case. Hence, we also multiplied \u0026ldquo;term weightages\u0026rdquo; with count of common unigrams while calculating BLEU scores. Term weightages were calculated from the term counts (TC) of each word in the test corpus as follows: This gave us significantly better search results.\n  One drawback still remaining in these methods is that we are looking for common words between query and captions, but any words with similar meaning that could also give relevant results are being ignored. In order to capture this similarity, we used the inner product of the BERT embeddings of the two sentences, as the similarity score instead of BLEU score. After applying term weightage to this method as well, we observe good search results.\n  In section Search Results, we show the results for \u0026ldquo;Search by image\u0026rdquo; API. The input image is randomly picked from google. We see an image with dolphins being returned in the results as the model has predicted its caption as \u0026ldquo;A man surfing on a wave\u0026rdquo;.\nConclusion In this project we started out with the aim of retrieving images based on textual queries whilst treating images as first class citizens rather than relying on meta-data of an image. We experimented with various image captioning models namely Vanilla CNN-LSTM network, CNN-LSTM with attention, CNN-LSTM using BERT embeddings. We evaluated the quality of captions generated by each of the model using BLEU score which we reported in table Blue Scores. Scores obtained by our models were fairly close to the referred models. We then implemented a Search API which given a user input query returned top 5 relevant images. We used two metrics at the core of our search API, BLEU-Score and cosine similarity. We used these scores with and without term weights and discovered that results obtained by weighted scores were much better than normal BLEU-score or cosine similarity. Within various n-grams of BLEU score, BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 gave the best results. As an addition we extended the textual search to incorporate image based search. We observed that the quality of the image based search depends on the quality of the captions returned by the captiong model.\nAppendices Search results Coco Vanilla Results Coco Attention Results Coco Attention with BERT Results Flickr Vanilla Results Flickr Attention Results Flickr Attention with BERT Results Computing Infrastructure The computing infrastructure used for training and running the models described in the paper was 1 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU.\nRuntime The average training time for the model on each combination of hyperparameters was roughly 7 hours for 20 epochs.\nSource Code The code is publicly available at Github repo: https://github.com/divyanshu25/ImageQuery.

We read through a lot of articles and found out the steps we layout below are the simplest way to deploy. Also, the biggest caveat to deploying in production is version mismatches, so we are going to be building things from source rather than using apt-get to install packages. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\n\nBuild and install custom version of python We used python 3.7.5 for a current project and here is how you can deploy python from source. Make sure you remove any other python version you might have on your machine. To remove any existing python installations.\nsudo apt-get purge python\u0026lt;version\u0026gt; sudo apt-get autoremove  \n1. Install Dependencies and packages. sudo apt update sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget libbz2-dev  2. Download source Now to fetch tar file for a specific python version use.\nwget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/Python-3.7.5.tgz  You can check out other python versions here: Link\n\n3. Compile python Now to compile the downloaded tar.\ntar -xf Python-3.7.5.tgz cd Python-3.7.5 ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/ make -j4 sudo make install  Argument in make -jN is the number of processors if you are not sure about number of processors in the machine. You can use nproc to get it.\n\nBuild and install custom version of wsgi mod Ok, now we move on to getting mod_wsgi installation right. Before we get into steps I would like you to read this Link. which essentially says this:\nThe problem in trying to force mod_wsgi to use a different Python installation than what it was compiled for, even where it is the same Python version, is that the Python installation may itself not have been compiled with the same options. This is especially a problem when it comes to issues around how Python stores Unicode characters in memory.  So to avoid this problem we are going to build mod_wsgi from the source and compile it with python we just installed in the last step.\n1. Compile wsgi-mod Download source code from: Github releases\ntar xvfz mod_wsgi-X.Y.tar.gz cd mod_wsgi-X.Y sudo apt-get install apache2-dev ./configure --with-python=/usr/bin/python make -j4 sudo make install  Configure Apache Ok, now we move on to building apache2.\n\n1. Install apache2 sudo apt-get install apache2  \n2. Configure Wsgi module Now we need to configure apache with the mod_wsgi we complied and installed in the last step.\nCreate a file: `/etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.load`  Add the following line to the file:\n`LoadModule wsgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so`  Now we need to enable mod_wsgi and restart apache2.\nsudo a2enmod wsgi sudo systemctl restart apache2  This completes the installation of Apache2 and mod_wsgi, all complied with python3.7.5.\nDeploying Flask Application 1. Create .wsgi file Now to deploy the flask application copy your code directory to /var/www/ directory and create \u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt;.wsgi file and add the following lines.\nimport sys sys.path.insert(0, '/var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;') from \u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt; import \u0026lt;flask_app\u0026gt; as application  2. Create virtualenv Its generally best practice to create a virtualenv for your application and install all the dependencies, to avoid clashing package versions that other application might be using. To create a virtualenv:\ncd /var/www/ virtualenv -p python3 \u0026lt;venv_name\u0026gt; pip install -r requirements.txt  Note that you will need a requirments.txt file. To create one you can do the following:\npip freeze \u0026gt; requirements.txt  3. Create Configuration file in Apache Now we need to create a configuration file to tell apache from where to load your application. In /etc/apache2/sites-available create \u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt;.conf file and add the following lines.\n\u0026lt;VirtualHost *:80\u0026gt; ServerName \u0026lt;Server_name\u0026gt; WSGIDaemonProcess \u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt; user=\u0026lt;user\u0026gt; group=\u0026lt;group\u0026gt; threads=5 \\ python-home=/var/www/\u0026lt;venv_name\u0026gt; WSGIProcessGroup \u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt; WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL} WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt;.wsgi \u0026lt;Directory /var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt;/\u0026gt; Order allow,deny Allow from all Require all granted \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; Alias /static /var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt;/static \u0026lt;Directory /var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt;/static/\u0026gt; Order allow,deny Allow from all \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; ErrorLog /var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;/error.log LogLevel debug CustomLog /var/www/\u0026lt;your_application_dir\u0026gt;/access.log combined \u0026lt;/VirtualHost\u0026gt;  You can remove that logging commands if you don\u0026rsquo;t wish to see logs.\n4. Enable application Now we need to tell apache to enable our application and load the configuration file we just created.\nsudo a2ensite \u0026lt;your_application\u0026gt; sudo systemctl restart apache2  That\u0026rsquo;s it. Your website is up and running on the public IP for the server.\n","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"a2dff113415ad63138f3854211637235","permalink":"/post/flask-apache/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/flask-apache/","section":"post","summary":"Tutorial for deploying Flask Application using Apache with mod_wsgi","tags":["Apache2","Mod_wsgi","Flask","Deployment","Ubuntu"],"title":"Deploying Flask Application using Apache with mod_wsgi","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574812800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574812800,"objectID":"545cfd4dcb51c4920983b846d806043c","permalink":"/project/rockoutcrop/","publishdate":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rockoutcrop/","section":"project","summary":"Using SegNet to extract rock outcrop from satellite images of Antarctica for various research purposes.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Extracting Rock Outcrop from Antarctic Landsat Imagery using Semantic Segmentation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"763098e35a27e6b2bc2baf306775704e","permalink":"/project/gray-video/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gray-video/","section":"project","summary":"Using CNNs and LSTMs to colorize gray scale videos, to bring them back to life.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Gray Scale Video Colorization","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" #title: \u0026lsquo;Engineering High-Throughput, Low-Latency Machine Learning Services.\u0026rsquo; #subtitle: \u0026lsquo;Serve your Machine Learning Models in Real-Time.\u0026rsquo; ##authors: #- admin #- Shirsh Bansal #tags: #- Distributed Computing #- Machine Learning Systems#\n#date: \u0026ldquo;2016-04-20T00:00:00Z\u0026rdquo; #lastmod: \u0026ldquo;2019-04-17T00:00:00Z\u0026rdquo; #featured: false #draft: false#\nFeatured image To use, add an image named featured.jpg/png to your page\u0026rsquo;s folder.
